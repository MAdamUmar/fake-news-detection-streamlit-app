# Fake News Detection Web App

A simple and effective web app built with **Streamlit** that detects whether a news article is real or fake using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier trained on TF-IDF features. The model achieves **99% accuracy** on the test set.

The **attached notebook** will walk you through the data preprocessing steps and model design and evaluation.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following:

- `app.py` â€“ The main Streamlit application  
- `fake_news_model.pkl` â€“ The trained machine learning model (SVM)  
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` â€“ The TF-IDF vectorizer fitted on the training data  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ List of Python dependencies  
- `Fake News Prediction Work Notebook.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook used for data cleaning, EDA, model training and evaluation  
- `Dataset.csv` â€“ The dataset used to train the model (optional, for reproducibility)

## Dataset

The dataset contains thousands of news articles labeled as either **real** or **fake**. It includes fields like title, author, and content. The focus was on the `content` column, which underwent preprocessing before feature extraction.

## Model Details

- **Vectorizer:** TF-IDF with `max_features=5000`  
- **Classifier:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel  
- **Accuracy:** 99% on the held-out test set  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Lowercasing  
  - Removal of non-alphabetic characters  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Stemming (PorterStemmer)
